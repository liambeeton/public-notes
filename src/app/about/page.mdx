# About

![Hiking Lion's Head](/lion.jpg)

I'm Liam Beeton. I'm a [software developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liambeeton) and my partner and I have two boys; the youngest is {new Date().getFullYear() - 2021} and the eldest is {new Date().getFullYear() - 2019}. So that keeps me busy for the majority of my waking hours.

I'm also a tinkerer, a lifelong learner and a collector of hobbies. So, on this blog, I invite you to share in my fascination with any or all of the following:

- Trail running and mountain biking
- Cybersecurity - open source intelligence (OSINT) and red teaming
- Artificial Intelligence - mainly high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
- Making music - electronic music and music production
- Photography - digital and film
- Building LEGO Technic - mostly supercars
- Sojourns around South Africa
- Adventures in parenting
- Bullet journals, second brain and intentional living
- And yes, programming and software development - I consider myself a pretty versatile developer (frontend, backend, testing and everything in between), so you should hopefully see that reflected in what I share here!
