# Job Interview Questions

Job hunting is challenging. Over the years, I have developed a list of questions to ask during interviews to better understand the company, its culture and the team. While I don't ask all of them in every interview, this list serves as a helpful guideline.

## The high-level questions

- What does the company do?
- How big is the company?
- What is the actual role?
- How many people are on the team?
- Who would I be reporting to?
- What is the salary package or salary range?
- What is the hiring process?
- What is your leave policy for vacation, sick and parental?
  - If unlimited leave - I typically like to take X number of days of leave a year, is that ok?

## Questions related to the team and work delivery process

- How does the team view code ownership?
- How does the team and company prioritise and plan work?
- What is the development process? Sprints?
- How many meetings are typical in a week?
- How long has the team done remote work?
  - How remote savvy is the company?
- How do the team and company brainstorm, research and plan work? Is this through meetings or RFC's
  - Is a meeting the first thing in this process or only if something cannot get resolved?
- How does the product team help the development team?
- How much autonomy does a developer have?
- When are typical meeting times?
