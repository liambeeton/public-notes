Hello ðŸ‘‹

These are my public notes. A non-linear place full of my ideas, research and work that I have done.

My interests are diverse and often evolve as I explore new topics or revisit previous projects. You can explore my writings on software development, particularly focusing on cloud deployment and modern web development. Additionally, I enjoy sharing my experiences in [trail running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/17232231), [mountain biking](https://www.strava.com/athletes/17232231) and [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/liambeeton). As an engaged parent, I also find fulfillment in sharing insights and lessons learned from the journey of raising my children.

To begin, simply click on any of the links listed in the sidebar to your left. If you'd like to learn more about me, feel free to visit the [about](/about) page.
