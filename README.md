## 🛠️ Customization

### Theme Configuration

You can customize the Nextra theme by modifying the `theme.config.js` file:

```javascript
// theme.config.js
export default {
  logo: <span>Your Site Name</span>,
  project: {
    link: 'https://github.com/liambeeton/public-notes',
  },
  docsRepositoryBase: 'https://github.com/liambeeton/public-notes/blob/main',
  // ...more config options
}
```

### Adding New Pages

Create new `.mdx` files in the `pages` directory to add new pages to your site:

```mdx
---
title: My New Page
description: This is a description for the new page
---

# My New Page

This is the content of my new page written in MDX.

<CustomComponent prop="value" />
```

## 📦 Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

The static site will be generated in the `.next` directory. You can deploy this to your hosting provider.

To test the production build locally:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```

## 🚢 Deployment

This site can be deployed to various hosting platforms:

const withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.js',
})

module.exports = withNextra({
  images: {
